# About my Website

The content on this website is mainly organized using [The PARA Method](areas/knowledge-management/the-para-method.md) (**P**rojects, **A**reas, **R**esources, **A**rchives).
The most important part is the **distinction between Projects and Areas**:

## Projects

> A project is a series of tasks linked to a **specific goal, with a deadline**.

The characteristics of a project are:

- **goal** to be achieved
- has a **deadline**

Examples include:

- Complete app website
- Develop project plan
- Pass final exams

## Areas

> An area of responsibility is "a sphere of activity with a **standard to be maintained over time.**"

An area does not have a specific goal, nor does it have a deadline. The characteristics of an area are:

- **standard** to be maintained
- **indefinite** end date

Examples include:

- Health
- Finances
- Professional Development
- Productivity
- Writing

## Why this is important

{% hint style="danger" %}
Areas of responsibilities are a **bad way to measure productivity** - if you don't make the distinction, **it will kill your motivation**.
{% endhint %}

How can you tell if you "live a healthier life", "learn new things" or "beeing a better spouse"?

Exactly: You can't! But its easy to tell if you:

- [ ] made sport 2 times this week
- [x] ~~planned a night out this month with your spouse~~
- [x] ~~subscribed to that new course~~

{% hint style="info" %}
Projects always fall into areas.
{% endhint %}

Maybe you already sense the pattern here: You came up with **projects _in_ your areas of responsibilities**. By connecting your projects to your areas of responsibilities, its easy to tell if you are effectively working towards your long-term goals - or if you mainly wasting your time.
