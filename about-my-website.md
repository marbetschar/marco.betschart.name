# About my Website

The content on this website is mainly organized using [The PARA Method](areas/knowledge-management/the-para-method.md) (**P**rojects, **A**reas, **R**esources, **A**rchives).
The most important part is the distinction between Projects and Areas:

## Projects

> A project is a series of tasks linked to a **specific goal, with a deadline**.

So the characteristics of a project are:

- **goal** to be achieved
- has a **deadline**

Examples include:

- Complete app website
- Develop project plan
- Pass final exams

## Areas

> An area of responsibility is "a sphere of activity with a **standard to be maintained over time.**"

No specific goal, no deadline. So the characteristics of an area are:

- **standard** to be maintained
- **indefinite** end date

Examples include:

- Health
- Finances
- Professional Development
- Productivity
- Writing
