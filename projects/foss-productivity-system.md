# FOSS Productivity System

## Principles

* Design is not optional _- the whole system should be easy AND enjoyable to use_
* Privacy is important _- but should not sabotage daily work_
* Freedom is key _- the system should favour community driven projects instead of products built by big, profit-oriented companies_
