# FOSS Productivity System

## Principles

* Design is non-optional _- the whole system should be easy AND enjoyable to use_
* Privacy is important _- and must not distract_
* Freedom is sustainable _- the system should favour community driven projects instead of profit-oriented companies_

## Core Features

* ⚠️ - the app is proprietary
* ✅ - the feature is available
* 👨‍🏭 - the feature is actively worked on
* ❌ - the feature is neither available nor actively worked on
