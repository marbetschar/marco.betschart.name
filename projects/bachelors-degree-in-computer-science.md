| <p><strong>Bachelor Thesis</strong><br><strong></strong><em>XR as a tool in the selection process of task force candidates</em></p> | My bachelor thesis deals with the evaluation of XR as a tool in the selection process of candidates for task forces. With the help of virtual reality the selection process could be be made more cost-efficient. At the same time a variability of the test scenarios could be increased, which is currently difficult to implement in physical reality.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
