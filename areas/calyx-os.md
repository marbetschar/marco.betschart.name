### Maps and Location

#### [SBB Mobile App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ch.sbb.mobile.android.b2c&hl=en_US&gl=US)

Resolving current location does not work. Although this is not a deal breaker, it is certainly an inconvenience.
Having the app automatically determine the current location in order to select the source or destination of traveling
makes dealing with the app significantly faster.
