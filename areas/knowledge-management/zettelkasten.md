# Zettelkasten

The "Zettelkasten" is a note-taking system invented by [Niklas Luhmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niklas_Luhmann), a German researcher who is considered
one of the most important social theorists of the 20th century.

{% hint style="info" %}
"Zettelkasten" is German for "slip box" or "card index".
{% endhint %}

A Zettelkasten enables you to to organize your notes into an entangled web of information. This in turn allows you to discover
new ideas and connections between your notes which otherwise would have been kept hidden.

The bigger your Zettelkasten grows, the more valuable it gets: Imagine a Zettelkasten which contains thousands and thousands of ideas.
If you now have a specific question and start to explore this Zettelkasten it will provide ideas which you've already forgotten a long time ago -
thus it will probably answer your question in surprising ways.

## The 12 Principles of a Zettelkasten

To make the most of a Zettelkasten, you should follow these 12 principles:

### 1. Atomicity

Each note should contain one idea and one idea only.

{% hint style="success" %}
This is key to link ideas.
{% endhint %}

### 2. Autonomy

Each note should be self-contained and comprehensible on its own.

{% hint style="success" %}
This ensures notes

- can be moved, processed, separated, and concatenated independently of its neighbors
- remain useful even if the original source of information disappears
{% endhint %}

### 3. Always link your notes

Whenever you add a note, make sure to link it to already existing notes.

{% hint style="danger" %}
> "each note is just an element that derives its quality from the network of links in the system. A note that is not connected to the network will be lost, will be forgotten by the Zettelkasten" - Niklas Luhmann
{% endhint %}

### 4. Explain links between notes

Whenever you are connecting two notes by a link, make sure to briefly explain why you are linking them.

{% hint style="success" %}
This is key to ensure you know why you connected the notes in the first place - even it is years down the road.
{% endhint %}

### 5. Use your own words

Use your own words to express an idea, so your future me is able to understand it - even years later.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Don't copy & paste!
{% endhint %}

### 6. Keep references

Add the reference to the original source to your note.

{% hint style="info" %}
This makes it easy for you to revisit the original source later on.
{% endhint %}

### 7. Add your own thoughts

If you have thoughts of your own, add them as notes.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Make sure you adhere to the principles of atomicity, autonomy, and connecting.
{% endhint %}

### 8. Don't worry about structure

Don't waste time thinking about a neat folder structure or preconceived categories.
The organization of the Zettelkasten develops organically.

### 9. Add connection notes

When you start seeing connections among notes, create "connection notes".
Their purpose is to link together other notes and explain their relationship.

### 10. Add outline notes

An outline note is a note that simply contains a sequence of links to other notes, putting those other notes
into a particular order to create a story, narrative, or argument.

### 11. Never Delete

Instead, link to new notes that explain what’s wrong with the old ones.

{% hint style="info" %}
This way, your Zettelkasten will reflect how your thinking has evolved over time.
{% endhint %}

### 12. Add notes without fear

You can never have too much information in your Zettelkasten.

{% hint style="success" %}
The bigger your Zettelkasten grows, the more valuable it gets.
{% endhint %}
