# The PARA Method

The PARA Method \(**P**rojects, **A**reas, **R**esources, **A**rchives\) is a tool-agnostic structure to organize digital information, with the goals of beeing universal, flexible, simple, actionable, cross-platform, outcome-oriented, modular and opportunistic.

To achieve its goals, the method requires us to classify each piece of information into one of four categories:

## Projects

> A project is a series of tasks linked to a **specific goal, with a deadline**.

The characteristics of a project are:

* **goal** to be achieved
* has a **deadline**

Examples include:

* Complete app website
* Develop project plan
* Pass final exams

## Areas

> An area of responsibility is "a sphere of activity with a **standard to be maintained over time.**"

An area does not have a specific goal, nor does it have a deadline. The characteristics of an area are:

* **standard** to be maintained
* **indefinite** end date

Examples include:

* Health
* Finances
* Professional Development
* Productivity
* Writing

## Resources

> A resource is "a topic or theme of ongoing interest."

Examples include:

* habit formation
* project management
* music
* online marketing
* note-taking

## Archives

> Archives include "inactive items from the other three categories."

Examples include:

* projects that have been completed or become inactive
* areas that you are no longer committed to maintaining
* resources that you are no longer interested in

## Projects vs. Areas

The distinction between projects and areas is very important and here is why:

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Areas of responsibilities** are a **bad way to measure productivity** - if you don't make the distinction to projects, **it will kill your motivation**.
{% endhint %}

How can you tell if you "live a healthier life", "learn new things" or "beeing a better spouse"?

Exactly: You can't! But its easy to tell if you:

* [ ] made sport 2 times this week
* [x] ~~planned a night out this month with your spouse~~
* [x] ~~subscribed to that new course~~

{% hint style="info" %}
Projects always fall into areas.
{% endhint %}

Maybe you already sense the pattern here: You came up with **projects** _**in**_ **your areas of responsibilities**. By connecting your projects to your areas of responsibilities, its easy to tell if you are effectively working towards your long-term goals - or if you mainly wasting your time.
