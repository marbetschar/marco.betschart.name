# Why elementary OS is the right choice for me

_January 2021_

## Philosophical Reasoning

### Community and Communication

The elementary team does a great job of keeping the community in the loop by publishing a summary of last month's updates on
[their blog](https://blog.elementary.io/). Those summaries are a joy to read because they are very well written and full of screenshots
which showcase the improvements described.

In my experience everything around elementary and its team is very open and forthcoming. Whenever I reached out with a question,
I received a helpful answer and if things weren't obvious the team truly tried to understand the matter before jumping to conclusions.

In my opinion this way of communication and the urge to truly understand the motivation _behind_ a request is what makes the difference.
Therefore, [getting involved](https://elementary.io/get-involved) is at the same time a lot of fun and rewarding.

### Design is neither an addon nor an opinion

The [elementary Design Philosophy](https://docs.elementary.io/hig/design-philosophy) is right on point: Design is something deeply integrated in whatever you create.
Its the sum of all the tiny little decisions. Its not something you can think of in an aftermath - its an intrinsic part of what you build. And the effectiveness of
a design is measureable: If the problem the design tries to solve is well understood, then the effectiveness of different designs can objectively be compared at solving
this problem.

Here we come full circle: As I mentioned, the community and communication all around elementary is about understanding the specific problem at hand - always with the
goal in mind to find the best possible solution.

And this approach really shows in to the overall UX of elementary OS in which [Accessibility Features Are Just Features](https://blog.elementary.io/accessibility-features-are-just-features/):
For example, the elementary OS [installer offers to switch to a left-handed setup if the users clicks on the `Next` button with the right mouse button](https://github.com/elementary/initial-setup/pull/133):

### Open Source does not imply Free Labour

Open Source does not force you into a [Walled Garden](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/walled-garden), does not see [you as the product](https://blog.elementary.io/you-are-not-the-product/) and on top of that, Open Source allows you to do with it whatever pleases you. Consequently you need access to the actual code of a
program, otherwise you can't do with it whatever you want.

And here comes the catch: A lot of people tend to ignore that Open Source is not about getting code for free, but rather about the freedom described above. And this
freedom is not built out of thin air - its built on top of labour.

That's why I really like the Pay-What-You-Can pricing model of elementary and its [AppCenter](https://appcenter.elementary.io/):
It makes the labour involved far more prominent and at the same time its much easier to send a developer a few bucks of appreciation through
such a platform.

And the best part of it: AppCenter is not limited to elementary OS. The [AppCenter for Everyone initiative](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/appcenter-for-everyone/#/)
enables AppCenter on other operating systems as well.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Folks on other Linux desktops can add AppCenter to their remotes and install apps with GNOME Software either by downloading a Flatpak ref file from <a href="https://t.co/oxcVTVldnO">https://t.co/oxcVTVldnO</a> or with the terminal command:<br><br>“flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists --user appcenter <a href="https://t.co/utDSsuDYyT">https://t.co/utDSsuDYyT</a>”</p>&mdash; elementary (@elementary) <a href="https://twitter.com/elementary/status/1482104137961508864?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 14, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 

### Privacy

Let's face it: At the end of the day the whole privacy discussion boils down to one thing - and thats trust. If you are working with some proprietary platform and trust it to
not share your data with an unwanted party, thats fine. But as you can't verify your trust, you shouldn't be too surprised if its unjustified. At the end of the day this 
proprietary platform exists in a profit-oriented world and its hard to keep such a platform accountable based on its marketing claims.

Therefore, I [neither want to be the product](https://blog.elementary.io/you-are-not-the-product/) [nor share private data with anyone I'm not fully aware of](https://blog.elementary.io/privacy-and-elementary-os/). So choosing elementary OS in terms of Privacy was a no brainer for me.

## Technical Reasoning

### Based on Ubuntu LTS: A stable, widely used low maintenance foundation

### Flatpak: App Sandboxing

### Upstreaming wherever possible

### Documentation

As a developer coming from macOS, I was pretty much spoiled by the Apple ecosystem. Especially in terms of its documentation: Design best practices
(Human Interface Guidelines), development, release processes and programming API's - everything is documented and a lot of examples are supplied.

So I was very pleased to find elementary OS does a marvellous job in terms of documentation too. Their documentation really helps getting involved:
They provide a [developer welcome page](https://developer.elementary.io/), [design best practices (Human Interface Guidelines)](https://docs.elementary.io/hig/),
[development and release process documentation](https://docs.elementary.io/develop/) and a [documentation for programming API's](https://valadoc.org/) as well.
On top of all that, in case you want to contribute to the operating system itself, there is even a [Contributor Guide](https://docs.elementary.io/contributor-guide/)
which helps you to get started with this as well.
