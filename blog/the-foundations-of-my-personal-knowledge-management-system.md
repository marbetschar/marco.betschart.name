# The foundations of my PKMS

_February 2021_

The more reference material I read in the last couple of months, the more apparent it became that I need to build my
Personal Knowledge Management System upon three different pillars. Each of which backing up a different purpose - but they
all work together as a whole.

This is how I ended up crafting this whole new website - which is my Publishing Platform; The first out of three pillars:

## 1. Publishing Platform

_My publishing platform is powered by [GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com/) - you are looking at it right now: It's this website._

The publishing platform is where all my distilled knowledge is available for my future self as well as the broader audience.
On this platform, you'll find everything I'm working on - along with howtos, manuals and best practices which proved to be useful for me.

## 2. Zettelkasten

_My Zettelkasten is powered by [Zettlr](https://www.zettlr.com/)_

[The Zettelkasten Method](../areas/knowledge-management/zettelkasten.md) allows me to keep notes usefull over time. It is a note-taking system, which grows organically in a way
which is similar to the way we tick: In an entangled web of thoughts. This method allows me to store my thoughts as well as
discover new connections between them. Therefore the Zettelkasten method is the centerpiece of my Personal Knowledge Management System.

## 3. Reference Archive

_My reference archive is powered by [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/)_

The world of knowledge is constantly changing: Websites disappear, books may no longer be accessible. Therefore it is wise to store the reference
material somewhere near. This is important to ensure we can revisit it in the future. In order to do so, you can use any Reference Manager:
They allow you to store a local snapshot of a website or archiving entire books.
