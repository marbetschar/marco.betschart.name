The more reference material I read in the last couple of months, the more apparent it became that I need to build my Personal Knowledge Management System upon different pillars. Each of which backing up a different purpose - but they all work together as a whole.

This is how I ended up crafting this whole new website - which is my Publishing Platform; The first out of three pillars:

## 1. Publishing Platform

_My publishing platform is powered by_ [_GitBook_](https://www.gitbook.com/) _- you are looking at it right now: It's this website._

The publishing platform is where all my distilled knowledge is available for my future self as well as a broader audience. On this platform, you'll find everything I'm working on - along with howtos, manuals and best practices which proved to be useful for me.

## 2. Zettelkasten

_My Zettelkasten is powered by_ [_Zettlr_](https://www.zettlr.com/)

The centerpiece of my Personal Knowledge Management System is [The Zettelkasten Method](../areas/knowledge-management/zettelkasten.md). This method is a note-taking system, which grows organically and works similar to the way we think: Atomic pieces of information build an entangled web of knowledge. This approach ensures my notes stay useful over time and also enables me to discover new connections amongst them.

## 3. Reference Archive

_My reference archive is powered by_ [_Zotero_](https://www.zotero.org/) _- see_ [_"Howto setup Zotero"_](../areas/knowledge-management/howto-setup-zotero.md) _to get started._

The world of knowledge is constantly changing: Websites disappear, books may no longer be accessible. Therefore it is wise to store the reference material somewhere safe, so we can revisit it in the future. This is where the reference archive comes into play: It allows you to store a local snapshot of a website or archiving entire books in an organized way. Therefore the reference archive becomes your own, personal library.
