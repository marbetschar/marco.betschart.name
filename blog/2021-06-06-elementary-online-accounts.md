This month I've worked together with [Dan](https://github.com/danrabbit) on a long awaited feature: The Online Accounts configuration page of the System Settings has finally landed! And I'm very happy it already made its way into your hands through the latest elementary OS 6 Beta.

Although the current version is still early work, it already provides the essentials: The possibility to configure calendar (which includes tasks as well) and mail accounts. This means, users are now no longer forced to install Evolution for initial configuration - which does a lot for the perceived user experience. This is especially true for newcomers. It also means, I can finally tick this off of my ["Missing Features & Workarounds" list for elementary](https://www.marco.betschart.name/areas/elementary-os/missing-features-and-workarounds#online-accounts).
