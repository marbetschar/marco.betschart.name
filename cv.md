# Curriculum Vitae

By now I've got over 16 years of experience in developing and operating software. I started by programming web based applications with ColdFusion (Railo, Adobe) or PHP, JavaScript, HTML & CSS as well as a wide variety of database backends (SQL and NoSQL). However, over the years my focus shifted more and more towards native application development. I worked with Java and Swift to build mobile Apps for example. In addition to software development, I've earned a deep understanding about service based architecture - as well as the management of said architecture on top of a Linux based server infrastructure (virtual and bare metal).
